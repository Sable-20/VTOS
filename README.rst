Description
-----------

VTOS is a hobby operating system being designed by myself simply because
I think it's fun and it gives me a project. Maybe one day it'll be
usable but for now that intention is just to have fun programming and
give myself a project so that my skills don't get rusty. I do fully
intend one day to try and make it have modules and be able to use Rust
and all those *fancy* things.

Installation
------------

Install the project with npm:

.. code:: bash

   # if you are on Mac
   ./mac.sh 
   # this will build the iso for you to use
