VTOS documentation
==================

**VTOS** is a hobby operating system that I am developing as a student while studying at UVM. While it is an operating system and a serious task I am also using it as a way to keep my programming skills sharp while I continue my studies and have less and less time to devote to a multitude of random programming projects that I would like to do.
